# Stock-Market-Prediction

***PART 1 - Predicting the price the next day using previous historical data***


***PART 2 - Predicting the price for the next 30 days***


WHAT I AM PLANNING TO DO NEXT...
-Revamp the code to include more parameters --> better prediction?
-Try tuning the learning rate, number of LSTM layers, hidden dimension size, batch size
-Try other losses or combine:
    MAE (mean absolute error).
    Huber loss.
    Evaluate with more metrics: MAPE, RÂ², etc.
-Post training stats: residual plots, training vs test data loss
-report findings


-Multi-step prediction (predicting several days into the future)
